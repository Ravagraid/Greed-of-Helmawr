	\textbf{Start date: 02/09/24}

	3 Cycles for Expansion, Downtime 1 week, 3 Cycles for Takeover

	Each Cycle is five weeks of time; four weeks for gaming, and one for preparing for the next Cycle.

	This is a Law \& Misrule campaign as defined in the Book Of Judgement, with the following exceptions;
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item No Brutes.
	 \item No Vehicles.
	 \item No unique characters (Dramatis Personae).
	 \item No Alliances.
	 \item Steps 5 (Post-Battle Actions) and 6B (Visit the Trading Post) of the post-battle sequence may only be done at the end of the cycle.
	 \item Each player starts with 1 Settlement which cannot be lost or traded. This is instead of the usual 2 Rackets they would otherwise have.
	\end{itemize}
